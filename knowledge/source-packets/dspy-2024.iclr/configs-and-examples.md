# Configurations and examples

## Runtime boundary

- Paper and repository versions are pinned in `source-packet.json`.
- Install dependencies from the retained upstream manifests.
- Supply model endpoints, credentials, datasets, and external services outside this packet. Never commit secrets.
- Use development or training splits for adaptation. Keep sealed benchmark test data outside retrieval and optimization state.

## Retained configuration and entry points

- `pyproject.toml`
- `tests/primitives/test_interpreter_factory_config.py`
- `tests/test_utils/server/litellm_server_config.yaml`
- `tests/reliability/generate/__main__.py`
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- `tests/examples/test_baleen.py`
- `tests/primitives/test_example.py`

These excerpts are preserved as upstream examples, not as a claim that the full system was rerun during packet ingestion.
